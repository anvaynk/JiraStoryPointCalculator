# Jira Story Point Calculator
1. This is a chrome extension that will calculate the total number of story points from all tickets in each of the swimlanes in a jira kanban board and will show this number in the header of each of these swimlanes.

2. It also keeps track of all the changes that are being done in the tickets in each of the swimlane and recalculates the story points.
